💻 I'm a software developer from Argentina with extensive experience developing software for several clients and projects mainly with Java and Spring stack.
</p>
<p>
🛠️ I'm currently fully dedicated to backend development in a microservices-based project.

<p>
📝 Over the years working in the industry, I have learned first-hand the importance of following best practices in software development, such as proper documentation, thorough testing, clean architectures, and staying up to date with the latest versions of the technology stack.
